An attempt at adopting the upcoming [Paranoia: Perfect Edition](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1990654819/paranoia-rpg-the-perfect-edition) into FoundryVTT as a system.

Currently only tested against Foundry V10 and V11

# Character Sheet

Currently the only real functionality from Paranoia: PE that has been implemented. Allows players to participate in character creation, keep track of their current mission, and their secrets.

## Dice Roller

Dice roller allows a player to select their attribute/skill combo, indicate the level of any equipment they're using, and indicate if they'd like to take a NODE penalty to increase their initiative order this round.

Computer dice are rolled separately "by" Friend Computer, for easier tracking.
